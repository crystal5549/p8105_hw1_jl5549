#The as.numeric funcrtion doesn't work on  the character vector. Beacause for logcial virables , one can use number to indicate true of false. And for factor variables, there are several levels that can be converted as numbers as well. But for character variable, there is no such a way to use numbers to indicate characters. 
# This helps explain why we can take the mean of logical viables and why we can't take the mean of character. But why we can't take the mean of factor variables remains unexplained.
